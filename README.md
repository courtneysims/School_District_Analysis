# School District Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate school distric performance of high school students in math and reading. The school board would like a better understanding of performance metrics and evaluate academic honesty. There appears to be some anomalies in the data in respect to Thomas High School's math and reading scores for the 9th grade students. The school board would like the analysis to include the replacement of the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with "NaNs" while keeping the rest of the data intact to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
